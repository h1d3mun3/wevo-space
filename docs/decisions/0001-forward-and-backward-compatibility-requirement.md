# Decision 0001: Forward and Backward Compatibility Are a Hard Requirement

## Status

Accepted — 2026-07-18

## Context

`wevo` and `wevo-space` together implement a decentralized system for recording and
verifying signed proposals/agreements between parties. `wevo-space` is the
coordination layer; `wevo` is the client. Critically, `wevo` has no single, fixed,
central `wevo-space` it must talk to — a given `wevo` client instance may connect to
any `wevo-space` deployment (self-hosted, run by a counterparty, run by a third
party), and there is no central authority that owns, operates, or can force an
upgrade schedule on every `wevo-space` deployment or every `wevo` client in the
network.

As a direct consequence, at the requirements level — not as an edge case, but as a
permanent, expected condition of this system — all of the following will happen,
indefinitely, simply because peers upgrade on their own independent schedules:

- A `wevo-space` deployment will be asked to serve a `wevo` client **older** than
  itself.
- A `wevo-space` deployment will be asked to serve a `wevo` client **newer** than
  itself.
- A `wevo` client will need to talk to a `wevo-space` deployment **older** than
  itself.
- A `wevo` client will need to talk to a `wevo-space` deployment **newer** than
  itself.

This differs from a typical hosted client-server product, where the operator controls
and can force-upgrade the server, and "backward compatibility" alone (a newer server
serving an older client) is usually sufficient. Here, there is no privileged "latest"
node — every peer is, at any given moment, potentially both older and newer than
whichever peer it happens to be talking to.

## Decision

We treat maintaining **both backward compatibility (this server, when newer,
continuing to serve older `wevo` clients) and forward compatibility (this server,
when older, continuing to work correctly when talked to by a newer `wevo` client)**
— each as strictly as practically possible — as a hard, ongoing architectural
constraint on `wevo-space`, not an aspirational goal.

- This constraint applies independently in both directions.
- Exactly how far back (or how far forward) support must extend — i.e., where an
  actual support cutoff eventually gets drawn — is explicitly **out of scope** for
  this decision and is left to future, separate decisions made per version boundary.
  What this decision fixes is the default posture: compatibility is preserved unless
  a specific, documented decision says otherwise.
- Every concrete technical mechanism for achieving this — API route versioning,
  the `signatureVersion` field, decoupling the marketing/package version from
  protocol compatibility, and any future mechanism — is an implementation detail in
  service of this constraint (see [Decision 0002](0002-versioning-and-backward-compatibility.md)
  and later entries in this directory). Those mechanisms may be revised over time;
  this constraint itself should not be relaxed without a conscious, explicit decision
  to do so.

## Consequences

- Any future technical decision or code change that would break compatibility in
  either direction requires its own explicit decision record justifying the break
  and, where the break is intentional, defining what happens to the peers it affects
  (deprecation window, migration path, minimum supported version, etc.). Silently
  breaking old *or* new peers is not acceptable by default.
- Forward compatibility (this server staying correct when talked to by a newer
  client) needs the same design attention as backward compatibility, which is easy to
  neglect because it is less immediately visible in day-to-day development (you
  develop against your own current client). Concretely: unrecognized fields, route
  versions, or `signatureVersion` values from a newer peer should be rejected
  explicitly and safely, not silently misinterpreted or allowed to corrupt state.
- This is the governing principle for this directory: read this decision first, then
  the version-specific technical decisions that implement it. A technical decision
  that only solves one direction (e.g. only backward compatibility) is incomplete
  with respect to this decision and should say so explicitly, as
  [Decision 0002](0002-versioning-and-backward-compatibility.md) currently does.
