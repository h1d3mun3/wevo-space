# Decisions

This directory records significant design and architecture decisions for WevoSpace —
things worth writing down so future readers know *why*, not just *what*. Each entry
uses a simple format: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences.

Decisions that affect the wire protocol or client compatibility must be mirrored by
a matching entry in the [`wevo`](https://www.github.com/h1d3mun3/wevo) client
repository's `docs/decisions/`, cross-referencing each other by number and title.

## Index

| # | Title | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| [0001](0001-forward-and-backward-compatibility-requirement.md) | Forward and Backward Compatibility Are a Hard Requirement | Accepted |
| [0002](0002-versioning-and-backward-compatibility.md) | Versioning and Backward Compatibility Policy | Accepted |

## Adding a new decision

1. Copy the format of an existing entry.
2. Number sequentially (`000N-kebab-case-title.md`).
3. If the decision affects the client-server protocol or signed message format,
   add a matching entry in `wevo`'s `docs/decisions/` and link the two.
4. Add a row to the index table above.
